Hi everyone,

I've built this bot to simplify the lame task that is selling steam cards, and is working great so far. I hope you can put this bot into 
good use.

In order to use it you need to install UiPath Studio (the free edition can be downloaded at this link: 
https://www.uipath.com/fr/start-trial ) and the Chrome extension for UiPath (can be downloaded using UiPath Studio). Is also important
that you have multi factor authentication enabled at your account.

After you run the bot, it will go to the login page, and start right after you press the submit button of the multi factor screen or press
enter on the textbox (that's why you need the multi factor authentication). From there, you just let the bot do it's job.

Keep in mind that the bot will only sell cards, and at 0,01 cent below the average price, but fell free to adjust the bot to your needs ;)
